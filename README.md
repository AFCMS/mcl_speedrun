# mcl_speedrun
Add a customisable speedrun engine for MineClone2
You can create additional speedrun type (see `speedrun.lua`) and send me a pull request if you want.
Be sure to fit the rules of an existing minecraft speedrun type (https://www.speedrun.com/mcce)

WARNING: this mod can only be played in singleplayer and do not save speedrun data on exit (storage is too complicated without a database)

WARNING: this mod require the last git version of mcl to work
